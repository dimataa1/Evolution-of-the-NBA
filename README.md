# 🏀 Evolution of the NBA: Comparing the 1990s to the Modern Era  

This project explores how the NBA has evolved from the rugged, defense-heavy 1990s to the fast-paced, three-point-dominated modern game.  
We use **data-driven analysis, visualizations, and statistical comparisons** to highlight changes in:  

- Team and player statistics  
- Pace and scoring efficiency  
- Shot distribution and accuracy  
- Defensive trends and physicality  
- Analytics-driven strategies  
- Team dominance across decades  
- Popularity and attendance growth
